This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter herein.

### 1.2 Financial Terms

"Fees" means all amounts payable by Client to Provider for Services rendered under this Agreement as specified in the applicable Statement of Work or invoice.

## 2. Service Delivery

### 2.1 Scope of Services

Provider agrees to perform Services as described in each Statement of Work executed by both parties. Each Statement of Work shall specify the scope, timeline, deliverables, and fees for the particular engagement.

Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet all deadlines specified in the Statement of Work. Any delays caused by Client's failure to provide necessary information or approvals shall extend the timeline accordingly.

Provider reserves the right to use subcontractors to perform Services, provided that Provider remains responsible for the subcontractor's performance.

### 2.2 Service Standards

All Services shall be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner consistent with industry standards. Provider warrants that Services will materially conform to the specifications in the applicable Statement of Work for a period of thirty (30) days following delivery.

Client's exclusive remedy for any breach of this warranty is for Provider to re-perform the non-conforming Services at no additional charge to Client.

### 2.3 Client Responsibilities

Client shall provide Provider with timely access to Client personnel, systems, and information reasonably necessary for Provider to perform the Services. Client shall designate a primary contact person with authority to make decisions regarding the Services.

Client is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all information, data, and materials provided to Provider. Provider shall not be liable for any errors or defects in Deliverables caused by Client-supplied information.

## 3. Intellectual Property Rights

### 3.1 Ownership of Deliverables

Upon Client's payment in full of all applicable Fees, Provider hereby assigns to Client all right, title, and interest in and to the custom Deliverables specifically created for Client under a Statement of Work.

This assignment excludes Provider's pre-existing intellectual property, third-party components, and Provider's general knowledge, skills, and experience.

### 3.2 Provider Tools and Materials

Provider retains all rights to its pre-existing tools, methodologies, templates, and general know-how used in performing Services. Client receives a non-exclusive license to use such materials solely as incorporated in the Deliverables.

Provider may use Client's project as a reference in marketing materials and case studies, subject to Client's prior written approval.

## 4. Fees and Payment

### 4.1 Fee Structure

Client shall pay Provider the Fees specified in each Statement of Work. Unless otherwise stated, Fees are quoted in U.S. dollars and exclude applicable taxes.

For time-and-materials engagements, Provider shall invoice Client monthly based on hours worked at the rates specified in the Statement of Work. For fixed-price engagements, Provider shall invoice according to the milestone schedule in the Statement of Work.

### 4.2 Payment Terms

All invoices are due and payable within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Late payments shall accrue interest at the rate of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less.

If Client fails to pay any undisputed invoice within forty-five (45) days of the invoice date, Provider may suspend Services until all outstanding amounts are paid in full.

### 4.3 Expenses

Client shall reimburse Provider for pre-approved Expenses incurred in connection with Services. Provider shall submit expense reports with reasonable documentation within thirty (30) days of incurring the Expenses.

## 5. Confidentiality

### 5.1 Confidential Information

Each party acknowledges that it may receive confidential and proprietary information of the other party ("Confidential Information"). Confidential Information includes technical data, business information, product plans, customer lists, and other non-public information.

The receiving party agrees to protect Confidential Information with the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information, but in no event less than reasonable care.

### 5.2 Exclusions

The obligations in this Section shall survive termination of this Agreement and continue for a period of three (3) years from the date of disclosure of the Confidential Information.

## 6. Warranties and Disclaimers

### 6.1 Limited Warranty

Provider warrants that Services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner. Client's exclusive remedy for breach of this warranty is re-performance of the deficient Services.

Provider does not warrant that Services will be uninterrupted or error-free, or that all defects will be corrected.

### 6.2 Disclaimer

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, PROVIDER MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

Provider does not warrant that Software will meet Client's requirements or that operation of Software will be uninterrupted or error-free.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

### 7.1 General Limitations

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, PROVIDER'S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY CLIENT TO PROVIDER IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.

This limitation applies regardless of the legal theory of liability, whether in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise.

### 7.2 Excluded Damages

IN NO EVENT SHALL PROVIDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY EXCLUDED DAMAGES, EVEN IF PROVIDER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation may not apply to Client.

In the event of an infringement claim, Provider may, at its option: (i) obtain the right for Client to continue using the Deliverables; (ii) replace or modify the Deliverables to make them non-infringing; or (iii) terminate the applicable Statement of Work and refund pro-rata Fees paid for the infringing Deliverables.
